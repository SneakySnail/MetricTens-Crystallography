# MetricTens-Crystallography

This GUI was created in MATLAB and serves as an educational tool for both novice and experienced crystallographer, and as a quick tool to make crystallographic computations. This GUI allows the creation of stereographic projection as well as the individual computation of angles between planes and directions for all seven crystal systems. Those who work in preferred orientation of polycrystalline materials or single crystals might find this GUI useful.
